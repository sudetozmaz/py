This project was created to be a real, fast, and an efficient replacement for the C++ coded code/giftcard generator.
The fact stays as a fact that Python is much more slower than a C++, or Java based codes, however, it will work for your job at the moment.
I have made the whole project open-source.
In the future willing to add a perfect GUI to have a better looking when you start the program that would not confuse the users.

However, at the moment it will help you to get the random generated letters/numbers and get your job and time faster to be done!
